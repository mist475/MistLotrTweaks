# Mist475's Lotr Tweaks

This mod adds some QoL changes to the [Lotr mod: Legacy](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-lord-of-the-rings-mod-legacy) by Mevans.

## Requirements

- [UniMixins](https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/UniMixins)
- [Lotr mod: Legacy](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-lord-of-the-rings-mod-legacy) or one of it's sub-mods

## What it does

QoL changes for the lotr mod.
I've spent a lot of time playing with the lotr mod, it's the only content-adding mod I've consistently played with over the years.
Yet there's always minor annoyances, things that could be more convenient, incompatibilities with other mods, etc.
With this mod I'm trying to fix some of these.

Every feature the mod adds is controlled by the config. Making it possible to enable/disable specific parts of the mod.
At the moment the only changes are client-side, though I'm planning on adding server side-changes as well.


If Mevans wants to incorporate any of my changes into lotr itself/ implement a similar feature he is more than welcome to do so.

Feature list:

- Fellowship permission icons are now shown in the main fellowship screen as well as the per-fellowship screen (see image)

- When reforging, the item tooltip is now shown permanently to make reforging items less tedious TODO: image
